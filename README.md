# ðŸš€ Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable)

## Starting in dev mode

1. To install packages, run:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

1. Then run:

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start NextJS locally and spin up a local web server you can connect to.

1. Open your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

# ðŸ’» Technology

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
  > NextJS is used as a build engine - not a runtime. In production, this website is deployed as a static site, so should avoid using NextJS's API feature, as it will not work in production.
# ðŸ§ª Testing

To run the unit tests, run:
```sh
yarn test
```

You can also run them in watch mode with:
```sh
yarn test --watch
```

- [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [@testing-library/react-hooks](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/)
  > You should avoid writing tests for all hooks, particularly if you can test the hook by just testing the component that's using it.
